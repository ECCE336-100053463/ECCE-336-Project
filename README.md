Executive Summary:

We are in a day and age where most parents have to work to pay their bills. Thus, they are away from their kids for most part of their days. So, this is especially a problem for newborns. Where parents have to ask someone to look after their babies as soon as the mother's maternity leave is over. Whether that be a nanny or a family member. But even then, parents are not at ease thinking about their baby for most of their days, getting easily distracted at work. So, we are proposing to have a surveillance system connected to a mobile application that allows parents to easily check on their child's room anytime anywhere. All will be connected to a private server to maintain privacy. The most suitable option for a private and secure server is to rent a Virtual Private Server. This surveillance system could be further improved and enhanced immensely by implementing computer vision and image processing techniques. But, due to the urgency of the project, it would be hard to fit within the time constraints.

This project will be split into three main phases. Furthermore, the entirety of the project will be managed on Github. The first phase will be the requirements documentation. Where we will present our well-defined solution and requirements to the clients. This documentation will mostly consist of clear, straightforward, and easily understood tables and diagrams. The second of which will start after getting the client's approval. Where we will expand on the simpler diagrams from the prior phase using a tool that eases the process of creating diagrams named PlantUML. All our team's work and prototyping will be conducted on Visual Studio Code. Lastly, phase three. This phase will bring everything together and translate it into a functioning prototype programmed in Python programming language.
